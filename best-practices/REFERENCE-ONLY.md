## Active Workflows Go Here Instead:

```
workflows/
├── domain-research/
│   ├── instructions.md
│   ├── template.md
│   └── workflow.yaml
│
├── product-brief/
│   ├── instructions.md
│   ├── template.md
│   └── workflow.yaml
│
└── [your-new-workflow]/
    ├── instructions.md    ← Edit these
    ├── template.md        ← Edit these
    └── workflow.yaml      ← Edit these
```

## Workflow for Creating New Workflows

1. **Study** a similar workflow in `best-practices/`
2. **Copy** the relevant files to `workflows/[new-workflow-name]/`
3. **Customize** the copied files for your specific needs
4. **Test** your new workflow
5. **Refine** based on results

**Keep `best-practices/` unchanged** so you always have clean examples to reference.

**Remember:** This folder is like a cookbook - you read the recipes here, then cook in your own kitchen (`workflows/` folder).
