- Website monthly unique visitors increasing through organic search and social referrals
- Email subscriber list growing from content downloads and blog engagement
- Engagement metrics (saves, shares, comments, time-on-site) showing quality audience connection

**Content Quality & Consistency:**
- Publishing 2-3 blog posts per month with consistent quality and SEO optimization
- Instagram posting 4-5 times per week with cohesive visual aesthetic
- Monthly newsletter sent reliably with curated, valuable content
- Distinct brand voice maintained across all content types and channels
- Content backlog/calendar providing 2-4 weeks forward visibility

**Business Impact:**
- **Directory subscription conversions** increasing as content drives qualified international couple inquiries to venues/vendors
- **Vendor value perception** growing: they see FWS as THE platform to showcase work and reach premium international clients
- Content being shared/referenced by couples and industry (brand authority as "go-to reference")
- Clear metrics dashboard showing progress on growth and quality indicators
- Backlinks increasing from venue review posts (venues linking to their features)
- Roundup pages ranking for key "best venue" searches (by region/style/feature)
- Content refresh program improving SEO rankings on existing high-potential posts

**Brand Voice Consistency:**

- Editorial quality upheld across blog, social, newsletter (curated, thoughtful, poetic)
- International audience feels brand is both aspirational AND accessible
- Vendors describe FWS as "timeless elegance," "trusted reference," "essential for international couples"

## Key Decisions or Open Questions

**Strategic Tensions:**

1. **Breadth vs. Depth**: Should we cover all of France or focus deeply on specific regions (Paris, Provence, Côte d'Azur) to build category authority?

2. **Content Volume vs. Quality**: What's the optimal publishing frequency that maintains quality while building SEO authority and audience expectations?

3. **Audience Segmentation**: Should content strategy differentiate by source market (US vs. UK vs. Asian preferences) or maintain unified "international luxury" positioning?

4. **Monetization Timing**: When to introduce directory premium features or sponsored content without compromising editorial integrity and brand trust?

5. **Platform Prioritization**: Should Instagram remain primary audience growth channel, or diversify into Pinterest, TikTok, or wedding-specific platforms?

**Decisions Needed:**
- Content calendar structure: thematic months vs. evergreen mix?
- Vendor feature frequency: spotlight one per week or batch features monthly?
- Photography strategy: invest in original shoots vs. curated vendor photography?
