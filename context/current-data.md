## Current State

**Content Operations:**

**Current Publishing Cadence (9 posts/week):**
- **3x Real Weddings/week**: Showcase vendor work, venues (in/out of directory), and non-vendor weddings. Purpose: Vendors use our platform to promote their work on blog and social media
- **3x Venue Listings/week**: Adding new venues to directory identified as good fits. Purpose: Feature them on site, provide enquiries, convert to paid subscriptions
- **3x Venue Review Posts/week**: Highlight 5-star Google reviews venues received. Purpose: Backlink acquisition from venues (they link to these posts), build brand trust, drive to listing pages via internal links (nofollow links to Google reviews)

**Content Status:**
- Blog: [X] posts published in last 30 days; [X] in draft/planning
- Instagram: Posting [X] times per week; content pipeline [X] weeks ahead
- Newsletter: Last sent [DATE]; subscriber growth [trend - growing/flat/declining]

**Recent Wins:**
- [Example: "Provence château feature post drove 40% above-average traffic"]
- [Example: "Instagram reel on French wedding traditions reached 15K accounts"]
- [Example: "New venue partnership: Château de [name]"]

**Current Challenges:**
- Publishing consistency: [describe pattern - seasonal, capacity-based, etc.]
- Content ideation: [describe whether ideas flow easily or require deliberate effort]
- International resonance: [note which markets respond best to which content types]
- SEO performance: [describe organic search position - growing/flat/challenged]

**Opportunities Identified:**
- **Competitive Research**: Conduct content gap analysis against competitors to identify underserved destination wedding topics
- **Roundup/Best-Of Pages**: Build high-value pages targeting key searches ("best châteaux venues in Provence", "luxury Paris wedding venues", etc.) organized by region, location, features, styles - these are what brides search for when selecting venues
- **Content Refresh Program**: Systematically review and update stale published content with new information, fresh images, optimized links, competitive improvements based on similar high-performing pages
- **Vendor categories to expand**: [categories with demand but limited directory coverage]
- **Social platform potential**: [platforms not yet leveraged - Pinterest, TikTok, etc.]

## Data Sources

**Analytics Platforms:**
- **Instagram Insights**: follower growth, engagement metrics, reach, profile visits (review weekly - every Monday)
- **Google Analytics**: website traffic, session duration, bounce rate, traffic sources, top pages (review monthly - first week of month)

**Update Frequency:**
- Instagram: Review weekly (every Monday)
- Website: Review monthly (first week of month)
