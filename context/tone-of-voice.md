**What this means:**
- Emotion comes from the story, not flowery language

- Focus on the couple and their experience

**In practice:**
- Use specific sensory details: how the light fell, what the air smelled like, how it felt
- Include real quotes and reactions when possible
- Describe actual moments (the groom's expression, guests' laughter)
- Avoid generic romance clichés - find the unique emotional truth

### 3. Classic, Not Dated

**What this means:**
- Focus on what lasts, not what's trending now

## Tone Variations by Platform

### Blog Posts (Long-Form Content)

**Tone:** Editorial but conversational, informative, story-driven

**Characteristics:**
- Write like you're telling a friend about a wedding you attended
- Include specific details that create a clear picture
- Balance the story with practical planning information
- Use subheadings for scannability
- Keep paragraphs short and readable
- Let the couple's story drive the narrative

**Example opening (Natural):**
> "Sarah and James got married at Château de Villiers in Provence last June. The château has been hosting weddings since the 1700s, but this one felt different — maybe because Sarah's family is British and James's parents brought their own traditions from Scotland. They mixed everything together: kilts with French wine, afternoon tea before a long dinner under the plane trees, family silver from both sides on the same table. It worked because they didn't try to make it perfect. They just made it theirs."

**Avoid (AI-Style Opening):**
> "Nestled in the sun-drenched hills of Provence, Château de Villiers has hosted timeless love stories for over three centuries. Today, we're sharing Sarah and James's sophisticated celebration — a weekend where effortless elegance met meticulous attention to detail, creating an enchanting atmosphere of refined romance."

### Vendor Communications

**Tone:** Professional, respectful, collaborative, warm

**Characteristics:**
- Clear and direct
- Appreciative of their work and partnership
- Maintain brand standards but prioritize clarity
- Use their name and reference specific work when possible
- Balance professionalism with genuine warmth

### Supplier/Venue Listing Pages

**Tone:** Warm, evocative, story-driven — with substance underneath

**Characteristics:**
- Open with a sense of place — paint the scene so couples can feel what it's like to arrive
- Weave practical details (capacity, accommodation, location) naturally into the narrative rather than front-loading them like a spec sheet
- Use sensory, grounded language: describe what you'd see, hear, and feel walking through the space
- Let each section of the listing build on the last, guiding couples through the experience as if they're already there
- Be specific about spaces, architecture, and surroundings — concrete details build trust better than generic claims
- Include logistics (pricing, what's included, capacity) clearly but without shifting into a sales register
- Keep the voice personal and inviting — this should feel like a knowledgeable friend walking you through a venue, not a brochure
- Avoid sales pressure and generic adjectives; let the description do the convincing
- Close with a soft, natural call to action — never pushy

**Example venue description (On-Brand for Listings):**
> "Tucked into quiet countryside just outside Aix-en-Provence, Domaine de la Colline is a former winemaker's estate where old stone, climbing roses, and long views across the valley set the tone for everything that follows.
>
> The main house dates to the 18th century and keeps its original character — terracotta floors, iron-framed windows, and a wide courtyard shaded by plane trees. Ceremonies happen in the walled garden or under a canopy of oaks at the far end of the grounds, depending on the season and the light. For dinner, most couples set long tables across the courtyard, though there's a vaulted stone hall inside that seats up to 130 when the weather turns.
>
> The estate sleeps 22 guests across the main house and two converted farm buildings, each with its own entrance and courtyard. For larger groups, there are a handful of small hotels within ten minutes, and the domaine can help arrange transfers. Couples have exclusive use of the property for the weekend — from Friday afternoon through Sunday checkout.
>
> The in-house coordinator works with every couple from first visit to final song, helping shape the weekend around their priorities. The domaine partners with a small roster of local caterers, florists, and musicians, or couples are welcome to bring their own.
>
> Love what you see? For further information on hiring Domaine de la Colline as a wedding venue or to request a brochure with pricing and packages, please enquire here."

**Avoid (Too Stiff/Spec-Sheet Style):**
> "Domaine de la Colline is an 18th-century estate in Aix-en-Provence. The property accommodates up to 130 guests for ceremonies and receptions, with indoor and outdoor ceremony options available year-round. The venue features three reception areas and sleeps 22 guests."

**Avoid (Over-Selling/AI Clichés):**
> "Experience the ultimate luxury at this breathtaking château nestled in the Loire Valley. This exquisite venue boasts timeless elegance and sophisticated charm, offering an enchanting backdrop for your dream wedding. Every meticulously curated detail ensures an unforgettable celebration of refined romance."

**Key Principles for Listing Pages:**
- Open with a sense of arrival — location, landscape, and mood in one or two lines
- Use specific architectural and sensory details to bring spaces to life (not generic "beautiful" or "stunning")
- Thread practical information (capacity, accommodation, pricing) into the narrative naturally
- Walk couples through the experience: arrival → ceremony → reception → accommodation
- Mention what's included and what couples arrange separately
- Highlight what types of weddings work best here and what makes the venue distinctive
- Let the quality of the venue speak through vivid, honest description
- Close with a warm, low-pressure invitation to enquire — never salesy
- Help couples picture their own wedding here, not just read about the venue

## Cross-Cultural Considerations

French Wedding Style serves diverse international audiences. While maintaining consistent brand voice, subtle adaptations ensure resonance across markets:

### American Audience
- Emphasize practical planning timelines and ROI
- Be direct about logistics and budgets
- Use "couples" alongside "brides and grooms"
- Value transparency and clear expectations

### British Audience
- Lean into heritage and tradition
- Appreciate understated elegance and wit
- Use "whilst," "amongst" comfortably
- Reference classic British-French cultural connections

### Australian Audience
- Embrace approachable luxury
- Highlight experiential elements and adventure
- Warm, friendly tone (less formal than British)
- Emphasize relaxed elegance

### Asian Audience (China/Singapore)
- Emphasize prestige and exclusivity (when authentic)
- Highlight impeccable service and attention to detail
- Focus on visual perfection and photography opportunities
- Honor formality and respect in vendor relationships

**Important:** These are nuances, not different voices. The core FWS brand voice remains consistent — these are simply cultural sensitivities to keep in mind.

## On-Brand vs. Off-Brand Examples

### Describing a Château Venue

**On-Brand (Natural, Human Writing):**
> "Château de Rivière was built in the 1600s and sits in the middle of lavender fields in Provence. The stone walls turn golden in the afternoon sun. Inside, you'll find original wood floors and painted ceilings — the kind of details that come from centuries of care. It feels more like a family home than a wedding venue, which is exactly what makes it special."

**Off-Brand (AI Clichés):**
> "Nestled among the picturesque lavender fields, this timeless château exudes effortless sophistication. The opulent interiors boast meticulously preserved details, creating an enchanting atmosphere of refined elegance. This breathtaking venue offers an exquisite backdrop for your dream wedding."

**Also Off-Brand (Too Commercial):**
> "This AMAZING château is the ultimate luxury venue that will make your wedding absolutely unforgettable! With its Instagram-worthy vibes, it's the trendiest spot in Provence. Don't miss your chance to book this exclusive, glamorous location!"

### Describing a Wedding Moment

**On-Brand (Natural, Human Writing):**
> "When Claire stepped into the garden, her grandmother's lace veil caught on a breath of wind. Her groom turned around and smiled — the kind of smile that makes you forget anyone else is watching. The ceremony hadn't even started yet, but this was the moment their guests would remember."

**Off-Brand (AI Clichés):**
> "The bride made a breathtaking entrance, her ethereal gown flowing effortlessly as she glided down the aisle. Every meticulously curated detail came together in this magical moment of timeless romance and sophisticated elegance."

**Also Off-Brand (Too Casual/Trendy):**
> "The bride's entrance was totally viral-worthy! Her designer gown was absolutely to die for, and the venue was giving major fairy-tale vibes. So extra in the best way!"

### Offering Planning Advice

**On-Brand (Natural, Human Writing):**
> "Think about the whole weekend, not just the ceremony. The best French château weddings give people time to settle in — long dinners that stretch into the evening, morning coffee in the garden, a chance to actually talk to the people you invited. That's when the venue starts to feel less like a rental and more like yours."

**Off-Brand (AI Clichés):**
> "When selecting your dream venue, meticulously curate every element to ensure a flawless, unforgettable experience. The most sophisticated celebrations effortlessly blend timeless elegance with impeccable attention to detail, creating an enchanting ambiance your guests will treasure forever."

**Also Off-Brand (Too Commercial/Pushy):**
> "You NEED to book a château with these 5 must-have features or your wedding will be a total disaster! Here's the ultimate checklist for planning the perfect luxury French wedding that will blow everyone's minds!"

### Describing Table Settings

**On-Brand (Natural, Human Writing):**
> "Each table had linen napkins in cream, hand-written name cards, and simple brass candlesticks. The florist used what was growing nearby — olive branches, lavender, garden roses in soft pink. Nothing matched perfectly, but that's what made it feel personal rather than styled."

**Off-Brand (AI Clichés):**
> "The tables were adorned with exquisitely curated centerpieces featuring meticulously arranged blooms in a sophisticated palette. Each place setting boasted impeccable attention to detail, creating an ambiance of effortless elegance and timeless beauty."

## Voice Checklist for Content Review

Before publishing any content, verify it meets these standards:

**AI Detection Check (Critical):**
- [ ] **Zero AI clichés**: Scanned for and removed: timeless, sophisticated, nestled, opulent, meticulous, effortless, curated, boasts, stunning, breathtaking, exquisite, impeccable, ethereal, enchanting
- [ ] **Sounds human**: Could this have been written by a real person talking to a friend?
- [ ] **Active voice**: Used active verbs, not passive constructions
- [ ] **Specific details**: Replaced vague adjectives (beautiful, stunning, lovely) with concrete descriptions

**Content Quality:**
- [ ] **Show, don't tell**: Described what you see/feel rather than labeling it as "elegant" or "beautiful"
- [ ] **Conversational**: Reads naturally when read aloud, not stiff or formal
- [ ] **Welcoming**: Would a couple feel welcomed, not intimidated?
- [ ] **Clear**: No confusing or flowery language — gets to the point
- [ ] **Authentic**: Reflects real French culture, not tourist stereotypes
- [ ] **Useful**: Includes practical value alongside inspiration
- [ ] **Appropriate**: Tone matches the platform (blog/Instagram/newsletter)

**Quick Test:**
- [ ] Read it out loud — does it sound like something a human would actually say?
- [ ] Would someone share this, or does it sound like marketing copy?
- [ ] Can you picture what's being described, or is it too vague?

## Maintaining Voice Consistency

**For Claude:**
Write like a human. Every piece of content should sound like it was written by someone who knows and loves French weddings, not by AI trying to sound sophisticated. When in doubt, choose the simpler, more conversational option. Read everything out loud before finalizing — if it sounds stiff or robotic, rewrite it.

**Critical Rule:**
If you catch yourself using ANY of the forbidden AI clichés (timeless, sophisticated, nestled, opulent, meticulous, effortless, curated, exquisite, etc.), stop and rewrite. These words are red flags that signal AI writing.

**For human reviewers:**
Use this document as the definitive standard. When reviewing content, ask:
1. Does this sound like something a real person would say?
2. Are there any AI clichés that need to be removed?
3. Is it specific enough that I can picture what's being described?
4. Would I actually want to read this, or does it sound like marketing copy?

**The Brides.com Standard:**
Think of how Brides.com writes — conversational, specific, helpful, real. That's the benchmark for natural wedding content writing.

**Evolution:**
This document will be updated as we refine our voice. The core principle stays the same: write like a human, not like AI.
