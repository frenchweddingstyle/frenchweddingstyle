We're available for a call any weekday (except Wednesdays) between 9:00 and 18:00 EU time. We can make an appointment, but you can also just call us.\n\n**Our Venue & Services**\nThe 12th century castle, its impressive 17th-century barn and romantic Roman church are surrounded by a large garden with majestic trees. Renovated with an eye for detail and history, overlooking your own green valley, our chateau makes the perfect setting for intimate celebrations. In and around the castle, beautiful spaces abound. We have a fantastic place for every part of your program! \n\n**Packages & Prices**\nWe love to host creative organizers that like to bring in and do lots themselves. We are evenly happy to share our expertise and experience to plan your entire wedding, so you can concentrate on those things that matter most to you.\n\nAll weddings include: A) privatized use of the castle and terrains, B) two nights of accommodation for 26 guests and C) our drinks service.\n\n\"The Creative Organizer\" pack: You like to organize and bring in lots yourself!\n_Price: €6.700. Drinks service included._\n\n\"Let Us Help You\" package: You like to program yourself but prefer us to accompany you along the way and align contacts with local suppliers. \n_Price: €10.300. Furniture, deco & wedding planning included._\n\n\"The Complete Wedding\" package: Everything we think a wedding should include; venue and accommodation, furniture, decoration, photographer, DJ, hair & make-up, flowers, all food included, open bar and wedding planning. All of that for a very attractive fixed price but still with many options to customize within the framework. Have a look under the following link for more information on the [Complete Weekend](https://www.chateaubarayre.com/complete/). \n_Price: €18.800 for 3 days, 2 nights for 26 guests (~€22.300 for 4 days, 3 nights) + €220 per extra guest_\n\n**Accommodation**\nToday the castle offers 26 comfortable beds, including a princely 12th-century wedding suite. We are busy renovating the castle! Most probably we'll be able to accommodate 8 additional guests on-site in 2026 - hence 34 in total - and have between 40 and 50 beds available in 2027. Check [our website](https://www.chateaubarayre.com/nearby-accomodation) for an overview of nearby accommodations. \n\n**Personal & Sustainable**\nWe are a small personal location. We'll plan the wedding together and accompany you during your day and stay and sometimes even as bartender or chef! That's why we do only a limited number of weddings per season. \nWe believe there's no future of love, if we don't show love for our future. Hence, we source the best local and biological and seasonal food in collaboration with parties that share our values of quality and sustainability. We work with a small team of excellent locals that genuinely enjoy what they do and put their heart to it!\n\nAlthough social media is not in our veins, luckily others posted quite a bunch of pictures! Hence we'd like to invite you to follow our [Instagram](http://www.instagram.com/chateaubarayre/) or [Facebook](https://www.facebook.com/chateaubarayre/photos/?tab=albums)."
