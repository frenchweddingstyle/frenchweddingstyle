Inaugurated on December 16, 1862 by Napoleon III, the estate replaced the old castle of Fouche, Duke of Otranto and Minister of Police of Napoleon I. The chateau famously hosted the Ferrieres interview between Bismarck and Jules Favre during the Franco-German War of 1870, where Bismarck demanded the cession of Alsace and Lorraine as a condition of peace. The property originally contained 28 suites with central heating and hot and cold running water. An underground passage connected the basement to a neighbouring building where the kitchens were located, avoiding cooking odours in the main chateau. The property is now part of the Accelis group and also houses the Ecole Ferrieres hospitality and luxury management school.",
