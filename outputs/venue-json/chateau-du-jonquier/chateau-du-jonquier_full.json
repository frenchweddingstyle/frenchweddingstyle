The Romans were wealthy landowners who also launched the famous 'Carri' of Mazan, a folkloric event continuing in a 10-yearly cycle. In 1808, Count Francois Marie-Joseph de Paule de Sobirats and his wife Emilienne de Damas du Rousset became proprietors. They built the intimate chapel dedicated to Saint Andiol, consecrated by the Archbishop of Avignon on May 3, 1836. Count Francois died childless in 1859 and left the house to his great-nephew Gustave de Ripert-Barret. In 1929, the three daughters sold the property in a deplorable state. During WWII, the chateau became a home for deaf-mute and blind girls, subsequently sold to Mr. Rollin-Pinin and then the Westphal family. In 2025 — 300 years after construction began — Ellen and Tobias Alpsten acquired the Chateau du Jonquier and 4.5 ha of surrounding land.",
