Between 1876 and 1882, under the direction of architect Gabriel-Hippolyte Destailleur, the estate was entirely redesigned to host the grandest celebrations of the Belle Epoque. Commissioned by the Duke of Massa, grandson of Napoleon I's Minister of Justice, the chateau became a dazzling stage for Parisian high society. The Duke, described as a 'French Gatsby,' was a passionate collector, literary figure, and devoted patron of the arts who welcomed the creme de la creme of Paris to discover magical events. The festivities included lavish dinners, glittering balls, operas performed at the chateau's private theatre, classical concerts played by full orchestras, and fireworks that lit up the night sky.",
