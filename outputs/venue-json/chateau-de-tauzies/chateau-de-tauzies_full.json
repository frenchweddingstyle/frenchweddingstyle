Originally an agricultural domain, it bore the name 'Besinie' around 1828-1830 and belonged to Michel Barrau. When Augustin Louis Barrau, a Gaillac lawyer, acquired the property in 1851, he had a new residence built on a rectangular plan, inscribing his initials 'AB' on the doors. The principal buildings (chai, stables, agricultural shed, cowsheds, barn, dovecote, and housing) were constructed between 1851 and 1867, when his daughter married Philadelphe Thomas. Philadelphe Thomas was a physician, archaeologist, paleontologist, and mycology enthusiast who conducted archaeological research on the domain while managing the wine estate. After the death of Marie Barrau in 1899, the estate passed through numerous hands throughout the 20th century. Formerly a wine estate with up to 40 hectares of vines on 56 hectares, the Chateau was reborn in 2018 as an event venue and accommodation run by Nathalie Deschamps and Jacques Tranier.",
