It was destroyed and rebuilt several times throughout history, most notably as a glass factory and as a large coastal mansion. Henry and Marie Clews, an eccentric American couple, fell in love with the Chateau in 1918 and for 20 years invested their shared creativity into fully restoring it. Marie served as architect and landscape designer while Henry worked as sculptor, transforming the fortress ruins into a neo-medieval seaside artistic retreat surrounded by magnificent gardens. The couple organized extravagant parties for European aristocracy and American expats. Following Henry's death in 1937, Marie founded La Napoule Art Foundation in 1951 to honor his memory.",
