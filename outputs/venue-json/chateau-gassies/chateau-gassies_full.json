It underwent a complete 4-year renovation between June 2014 and May 2019, requiring 16 months of work per building. The owners worked with a local architect specializing in chateau renovation, using only authentic materials and local craftsmen to restore the property to its original 18th-century beauty without compromise. The main chateau was entirely renovated with its original layout reinstated, facades sanded, and a terrace added on the west side. The North building was converted from the coachman's house, tack room, Orangerie, and attics into guesthouses. The South building's old winery, barrel room, and bottling room were converted into the main reception room, gym, and wellness area with spa.",
