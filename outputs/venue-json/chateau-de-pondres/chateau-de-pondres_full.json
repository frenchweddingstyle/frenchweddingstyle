The chateau was the property of the great families of Anduze and Ganges. Its current architecture derives from a major campaign of works carried out in the mid-17th century by Pierre II de Crouzet. Like many monuments in the Gard, it was looted and set ablaze during the French Revolution. The Marquis de Montlaur was forced to flee. Joseph Isidor de Montlaur returned at the beginning of the 19th century. Raymond Archambaud de Montlaur carried out the complete reconstruction of the south wing. Acquired in 1920 by an agricultural engineer, the chateau fell into disuse throughout the 20th century. It became the property of the Conseil General du Gard in 2004 and was ceded in 2006 to the current owner for an immense campaign of works under the aegis of the Conservation des Monuments Historiques, which lasted 10 years.",
