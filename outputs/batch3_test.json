Plus the château, which would be privatized for your wedding, is warmer, since the thick walls have absorbed the warmth from the summer.\n \nWe don’t have a standard brochure, as each wedding is tailor made. I generally prefer to have a telephone conversation with the couple getting married, to find out more of how they envisage their wedding.\n \nI can attach here a few general pictures, and give you an approximate price, obviously to be redefined according to your specific wishes.\n \nFor weddings, we privatize our entire château for you, for 2 full days. Including accommodation for up to 20 guests sharing rooms (we have 10 en suite double/king size rooms, 2 of which are suites with an adjoining single room, and 3 of which can also be made up with twin beds, plus one single room and a double room of lesser quality on the second floor)\nThe price is 12’000 € for both nights, including daily breakfast and full use of all four reception rooms, as well as our family chapel, and also including basic floral arrangements and all the tables and chairs and plates/glasses/cutlery for your wedding reception.\n \nYou need to add on the caterer (we have a list of 3 we highly recommend, but can also work with one of your choice if you prefer), the champagne, the wines (we can recommend a few excellently priced good vintners if you wish), the DJ/ orchestra and photographer if you wish (we can recommend these as well), extra floral arrangements, wedding cake etc. We can also arrange for rental cars (we partner with Audi), an amazing classic Daimler long for the wedding, a horse and carriage, and of course chauffeur transfers with vans or mini buses.\n \nIt is also possible to have a barnum in the garden, looking on to the château, (see one photo) but this comes at an extra cost of around 4’000 € if chosen.\n \nFor your other 40 guests, there is a hotel/motel in the next village, Saint Calais, with rooms around 100 e per night, plus another chateau with 11 rooms and yet another with 8 rooms, of higher quality (priced around 400-500 € per night), 20 minutes drive from us.\n \nLet me know if I can help you with further information at this stage, or if you wish me to telephone you, do send me your telephone number and preferred time for a phone chat.\n \nWith best wishes,\n \nMarnie\n"
