      "brochure_text": "All our weddings at No3 are bespoke and so individually planned, designed and co ordinated to each couple, therefore we do not offer ’set prices’ for everything except the venue. \nIt really does depend what you want for your wedding but here is a base line idea of costs. It is all planned and designed with the wedding planner so no need to worry about the organisation in any way. \n\n> Have you seen our brochure on our website? It gives all the details of how our weddings work at No3. \n\n   €20,000 Venue inclusive of accommodation in the entire chateau for 12 people for 3 nights. \n    Including tables and chairs which would be around €2,000\n    Full fairy light canopy over the outdoor dining included (install price for this would be around €4,000)\n    NO CORKAGE CHARGES, which means you can buy your wine, champagne and beer through a local supplier at very reasonable cost. \n    This venue price including all of the above is inclusive of VAT. It is the price for up to 100 guests. €150PP extra for over 100 guests.   \n> \n> \n> Then you would have the following to consider based on 70 guests and a relative cost for 100 guests. These prices are a guide only from the suppliers, based on weddings this year.\n> \n> **Wedding day**\n> \n> **Catering**\n> \n> **€165pp**, this includes a pre ceremony drink, drinks reception drinks, canapes, 3 course dinner, wine with dinner, evening party bar, evening snack, staff, basic tableware. Total for 70 guests= **€11,550**\n> \n> **\\* this is a very standard fee, it could be reduced if you removed formality and the need for 3 courses.**\n> \n> **Rentals**\n> \n> This is not needed at No3 as this is included in the rental price but as set up is not included, it would be best to assume around €300-400 for a set up and takedown fee. Total **€300-400**\n> \n> **Photography**\n> \n> This can range from €2000-10,000 with a fair average being around **€4000**\n> \n> **Videography**\n> \n> Same as above and a little more expensive but on average **€4000**\n> \n> **Celebrant **\n> \n> **€1000 but quite often couples like to ask a close family member or friend. **\n> \n> **Florals and props**\n> \n> Average floral spend is **€4000** which would give a decent amount for 70 guests. You might want more or less florals and props.\n> \n> **DJ**\n> \n> A DJ for the full day will be around **€2000**\n> \n> **Band**\n> \n> A very average wedding band will cost around **€4000 **some including equipment and others not, if it is not including equipment add another €1000 to this cost.\n> \n> \n> **Hair and makeup**\n> \n> 1 bride plus 4 bridesmaids, hair and makeup would cost around **€1000-€1500**\n> \n> **Transport **\n> \n> **€700** per 55 seater bus per return journey per day. This would bring all guests to and from the nearby town of Cognac (15 minutes) where the majority would be staying. \n> \n> **Pre wedding event**\n> \n> This can cost very little, Luciole's allow them to hire it out on a minimum spend of €2000 but the guests pay for this, if they do not reach if the clients pay the difference. A rooftop will cost around €5000 with some drinks and food. Bar Lys is around €3000 inclusive of some drinks and snack boards\n> \n> **Post wedding event**\n> \n> A post wedding BBQ with drinks will cost somewhere around **€60pp**\n> \n> **Planner**\n> \n> **€6,000 minimum/approx.**\n> \n> **Insurance-mandatory**\n> \n> **€500 aprox**\n> \n> A grand total for No3 inclusive of:\n> \n> Venue- €20,000\n> Planner- €6000\n> Catering x 70 guests- €11,500\n> Alcohol all day-included above\n> Rental items(crockery & tableware etc)-included but €400 to add for set up\n> Florals- €2500(minimum)\n> Entertainment (DJ)- €2000\n> Photographer- €4000\n> Transport- €700\n> Insurance- €500\n> Hair & makeup- €1500\n> Celebrant- €1000\n> \n> **70 guests = £42,000 (€50,000)** (this is not including a pre or post wedding event & it is a DJ not a band, plus the floral spend is €2500) and no videographer. This also does not include rings, suits, dresses, stationary.\n> \n> **100** guests based on the above=**£49,000 (€58,000) **-higher minimum floral spend & more transport required"
