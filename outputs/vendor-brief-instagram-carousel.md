# Your Expertise. Our 1,000,000+ Reach.

**A collaboration opportunity from French Wedding Style (@frenchweddingstyle)**

## The Opportunity

French Wedding Style has built one of the largest engaged audiences in the destination wedding space — **54,000+ followers**, the majority of whom are English-speaking couples actively planning weddings in France.

But follower count is only part of the story. Our educational content reaches far beyond our own audience. A single carousel post — "How much does a wedding really cost in the south of France" — was viewed **over 1.1 million times**. Not boosted. Not paid. Pure organic reach.

We're now launching a dedicated educational carousel series, and **we want to put your expertise in front of that audience**.

---

## How It Works

We co-create a **6-slide educational carousel** featuring your insider knowledge, published using Instagram's **Collab feature**. That means:

- The post appears on **our feed AND your feed** simultaneously
- All likes, comments, saves, and shares are **shared between both accounts**
- Your name and handle are front and centre — on the post itself AND in the caption

You provide the expertise. We design, write, and publish. The reach is shared.

## The Reach You're Getting Access To

| | |
|---|---|
| **54,000+ followers** | Engaged international couples planning weddings in France |
| **1.1 million views** | Achieved organically on a single educational carousel |
| **UK, US, Australia, Ireland** | Our core audience — high-intent destination brides |
| **Evergreen discovery** | Carousels continue to surface through Search and Explore for months |

This isn't a tagged mention or a story reshare. This is a **permanent post on both feeds**, designed to educate and engage — the format Instagram's algorithm rewards most.

### What to send us

1. **Your template choice** (1-5)
2. **Your 4 tips/insights** — one specific, surprising sentence per slide
3. **4 portrait images or short videos** — behind-the-scenes, process shots, or finished work (high quality, vertical format)

That's it. **About 30 minutes of your time.** We handle the design, caption, hashtags, and posting.

---

## The Process

1. **You send us** your topic, tips, and images
2. **We design** the carousel and write the caption
3. **You approve** the final version — nothing goes live without your sign-off
4. **We post with Collab** — you accept the invite, and the post goes live on both feeds

---

## Why This Works For You

Most vendor features on wedding blogs are static — a gallery, a listing, a link. This is different.

This puts your voice, your expertise, and your name in front of **hundreds of thousands of potential clients** in a format that drives real engagement. Couples save these posts. They share them. They follow the experts featured in them.

You're not just being listed. You're being positioned as the authority in your field.
