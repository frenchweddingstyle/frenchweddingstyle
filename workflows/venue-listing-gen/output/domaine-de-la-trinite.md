### About the Venue

Domaine de la Trinité is a restored 19th-century wine estate in Mauguio, just outside Montpellier. The Mediterranean is ten minutes one way, the old city fifteen the other, and vineyards fill the view behind.

The heart of the place is a 200 m² Orangery — floor-to-ceiling glass, Bose sound, built-in lighting — seating 150 for dinner or 200 standing. An adjoining 80 m² stone room gives couples a second flexible space. Outside, 5,000 m² of grounds include a ceremony kiosk, a wide furnished terrace, and an infinity pool that catches the afternoon light.

Every wedding gets full privatisation and a coordination team covering planning, supplier management, and the day itself. Couples looking for [wedding venues with on-site accommodation near Montpellier](https://www.frenchweddingstyle.com/locations/south-of-france/occitanie/montpellier/) will find 16 beds across five suites on the estate.

### Accommodation & Amenities

* **Accommodation:** The estate sleeps 16 across five different spaces. The Prestige Suite comes with every booking for the couple. Four more units — the Deluxe, Junior, Superior, and a Loft built into the old wine vats — sleep up to 14 guests and can be added as a Suites Pack. Each one has its own layout and feel. For bigger wedding parties, the Domaine works with hotels nearby, all within a five-minute drive, and can arrange shuttle transfers.

* **Amenities:** A 100 m² infinity pool and clay tennis court are open the day after the wedding — a good excuse for guests to stay on. The 160 m² terrace comes furnished with parasols, and all reception furniture is provided: 150 chairs inside, 150 for the ceremony outdoors, round and rectangular tables, and high cocktail tables. The Orangery has a Bose L1 Pro 8 sound system with wireless microphones and lighting effects. A photo booth is available for €400 (prints, GIFs, online gallery). On-site parking and Wi-Fi included.

Private celebrations (birthdays, baptisms, vow renewals, family gatherings) and commercial shoots are welcome too.
